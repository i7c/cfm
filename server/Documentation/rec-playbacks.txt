Endpoint /rec/v1/playbacks
----------------------

The endpoint can be used to
* create playbacks
* create a batch of playbacks
* get a list of playbacks
* get a single playback
* set a currently playing track
* get the currently playing track
* get an accumulation of broken playbacks
* fix an accumulation of broken playbacks

Resources
---------

The central resource on this endpoint is a Playback. A Playback represents the
act of a user playing a specific track at a certain point in time.

A Playback comprises the following properties:

* artists: a list of strings representing artist names. The minimum size of the
  list is 1 for both writing and reading.

* recordingTitle: the title of the played recording. The minimum length of the
  string is 1 character for both writing and reading.

* releaseTitle: the title of the release (album/single/...) from which the
  played recording is played back. The minimum length of the string is 1
  character for both writing and reading.

* timestamp: a UTC time stamp in seconds (epoch seconds since 1970) specifying
  when the playback occurred.  This field is optional. If you do not specify it,
  the server will use the current time as time stamp.

* playTime: Time in seconds specifying how long the track was actually played.
  The time can be lesser or greater than trackLength (e.g. if you seek back in
  the track and listen to some parts of it twice, it will be greater than
  trackLength). Please read the notes about 'Playback Threshold' below. If you
  do not specify this property, it will be set to trackLength.

* trackLength: length of the track being played, as reported by the music
  player. This information can help to identify the track in the musicbrainz
  database. The field is optional, if you do not specify it, it will be
  "undefined".

* discNumber: Number of the disc on which this track resides. This is merely
  useful to identify the track on musicbrainz. The field is optional.

* trackNumber: track number on the disc can be used to identify the track on
  musicbrainz. The field is optional.

* broken: Read-only field indicating whether the recording could be identified
  in the musicbrainz database. If 'broken' is true, then no recording was found
  that matched well enough. You can read below about how to "fix" "broken
  playbacks". Also read the implications of broken playbacks below.

* id: A unique immutable identifier of this playback. You can specify the id
  when writing Playback resources. If you omit it, the server will assign an
  identifier.

* source: a string indicating "where this Playback came from". For usual
  playbacks this might be the host or device where the track was played (cfm
  perl client uses the hostname as default). There is one special value "lastfm"
  which indicates that the Playback was imported from lastfm. This is useful to
  detect duplicates when reimporting. Other than this value, clients can set
  anything they like. The information can be used to drop all playbacks from one
  source for example.


Playback Threshold
------------------

Clients can specify both trackLength and playTime. The former indicates the
length of the track as such and the latter indicates how many seconds of the
track were actually played. Please note: while the absolute value of trackLength
might be significant to identify the track on musicbrainz, the relation between
trackLength and playTime is insignificant for the server.

We recommend to only create a playback if playTime/trackLength > 1/2 holds true,
but the server does not enforce that. Playback thresholds are for the client to
decide.
